Fashion GNN for Product Recommendations

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project builds a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to generate fashion product recommendations using Pinterest Fashion Data. The model learns meaningful relationships between products and provides recommendations based on embeddings.

âœ… Goal: Develop a recommendation system that suggests similar fashion products.
âœ… Approach: Construct a graph-based model where nodes represent products and scenes, and edges define relationships like category similarity and scene co-occurrence.
âœ… Challenges: Addressed embedding over-smoothing, high similarity issues (~0.999 cosine similarity), and sparse graph connectivity.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset consists of:

fashion.json â€“ Defines product-to-scene relationships.

fashion-cat.json â€“ Provides multi-label product category data.

This repository used the Pinterest shop the look data used in the following paper:
